Predicting the US 2020 Presidential election results. Data to predict how a person is going to vote

**Purpose**

The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight on on how a person will vote in the 2020 US Presidential Election for swing states

**Project Overview**

The United States presidential election is among some of the most influential factors on not only the local market but also the global economy. Given the significance of the US Presidential Election and how it is capable of influencing the global economy, this group of scholors have attempted to predict the outcome of how a person is likely to vote during the 2020 US Presidential Elections. This project will attempt to use machine learning to predict the relationship between the different demographics such as race, age, gender, income to name a few and candidates'/party voter prefrerence totals for U.S. President. Political and economic variables are utilized in the model, and significant variables are identified through further analysis and statistical procedures.

Reason why the topic was selected:

- Current / Trending Topic
- Real Time / Predictor or present camparative data against actual outcome to ...

Questions hoped to answer with the data are:

1. Is the model able to predict Voter Preference
2. Are the results of the poll similar to the outcome of the 2020 election for the states selected.
3. What the are comparative results, if any
4. Does the predictors have a correlation to the voter preference

**Resources**

Data Source: Data for this projects was drawn from a private source i.e a data collection company that specializes in electorial polling. They played a significant role in collecting polling data throughout the 2020 election cycle.

- Sample Size: 1200
- Margin of Error: Â± 2.8%
- Scheduled Field Date: July 2020
- Methodology: Online panel.
- Respondents: Likely November 2020 voters from AZ, MI, NC, PA, WI. Suburban voters.

The group have agreed to meet on the following days:

1. Monday - Zoom Meeting - Review project requirements and deliverables and assign tasks to members
2. Wednesday - Zoom Meeting - To review the progress attempted so far, discuss impediments and or challeges in attempt to move on to next phase of the assignment
3. Saturday - Skype Meeting - To finalize work done, and review for further improvemnets
4. Sunday - Skype Meeting - To discuss and review final submissions for the project

A group channel have also been created on Slack to discuss ad hocly any impedediments, challenges members may have over the course of the project.
